# ERP-SYS

A modern Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system built with **Next.js**, featuring a **monorepo structure** powered by **Turborepo**. This project includes a frontend application, a backend API server, and shared packages for UI components and database access.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v18+ (LTS recommended)
- **pnpm**: v8+ (for monorepo dependency management)

---

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ERP-SYS.git
   cd ERP-SYS
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `db` folder with the following template:
     ```properties
     DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
     DIRECT_URL="your-direct-database-url"
     ```
     - `DATABASE_URL`: The main connection string for your database.
     - `DIRECT_URL`: A direct connection string for bypassing connection pooling (if applicable).
   - Create a `.env` file in the `app/web` folder with the following template:
     ```properties
     DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
     DIRECT_URL="your-direct-database-url"
     ```
4. **Set up the database**:

   - Apply Prisma migrations:
     ```bash
     pnpm --filter db prisma migrate dev
     ```
   - (Optional) Open Prisma Studio to explore the database:
     ```bash
     pnpm --filter db prisma studio
     ```

5. **Start the development servers**:
   - Start all apps:
     ```bash
     pnpm run dev
     ```
   - Or start specific apps:
     ```bash
     pnpm --filter web dev
     pnpm --filter server dev
     ```

## Development

### Adding UI Components

To add new components from `shadcn/ui` to the frontend:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component-name] -c apps/web
```

## Database Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **ORM**: Prisma
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Schema**: Multi-tenant architecture with role-based access control

### Schema Overview

The ERP-SYS database is built around a **template-based KPI management system** with the following key components:

#### Core Entities

1. **QOC (Quality of Academic and Career)** - System administrators who create and manage templates
2. **Departments** - Organizational units within the institution
3. **Users** - Department members with role-based access (HOD, KPI Coordinator, Faculty)
4. **Pillar Templates** - Organizational framework templates created by QOC
5. **KPI Templates** - Performance indicator templates with form structures
6. **Department Pillars** - Department-specific instances of pillar templates
7. **Department KPIs** - Operational KPI tracking with performance data

#### Key Features

- **Template System**: QOC creates reusable pillar and KPI templates
- **Department Assignment**: Templates are assigned to departments as working copies
- **Role-Based Access**: Three user roles with different permissions
- **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive KPI status management and progress monitoring
- **Form Builder Integration**: JSON-based dynamic forms for data collection
- **Data Isolation**: Department-level data access controls

#### Data Flow

```
QOC Creates Templates ‚Üí Assigns to Departments ‚Üí Department Copies Created ‚Üí Users Fill KPIs
```

#### User Roles & Permissions

- **QOC**: Full system access, template creation and management
- **HOD**: Department management, KPI assignment, user coordination
- **KPI Coordinator**: KPI fulfillment coordination within department
- **Faculty**: KPI data entry and completion
